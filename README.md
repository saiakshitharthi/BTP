## Description

This project explores the development of a novel architecture for unsupervised semantic segmentation using self-supervised learning. The objective is to achieve impressive segmentation performance without requiring large amounts of labeled data.

## Key Achievements

- Proposed a novel self-supervised learning-based architecture for unsupervised semantic segmentation that leverages pseudo labels effectively.
- Achieved a significant improvement in mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 71.04 on the PASCAL VOC dataset, representing an 11% boost compared to the baseline model.
- Demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed approach in scenarios where labeled data is scarce.
